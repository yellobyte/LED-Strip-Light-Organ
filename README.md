# LED-Strip Light Organ #

A light (or color) organ is an electronic device which converts an audio signal into rhythmic light effects. Invented in the 70's they are still popular in discotheques and party rooms though.
Now that LED strips became fairly cheap they can replace normal light bulbs used in the earlier years and make the color organ look more modern.

The electronic circuit of a normal light organ separates the audio signal into several frequency bands and dimms the light bulbs or LEDs according to the average level of each band.
For a decent visual impression at least 3 channels are needed: low frequencies (bass), middle frequencies and high frequencies (treble). For best visual results each channel should controle a light sources of different color, e.g bass = red, middle = yellow and treble = green.

In our case we control 3 LED strips that are specified for 12V DC. The device can deliver a few amperes per channel, in my case the external power supply at hand (Mean Well GS90A12) can only deliver 6.7A DC so I set the limit to about 2.2A per channel using trimpots (trimmer potentiometer). The used driver MOSFETs IRF540N operate way from their limits and only get handwarm.

Since different LED strips vary in their electrical parameters, their respective current ratings and the external 12V power supply you have available determine the length of the LED Strips you are able to use in the end.

The LED Strips I have tested with are equipped with 3528 SMD LEDs, have 60 LEDs per meter and are 5m long. They proved no problems at all and never triggered the electric overload circuitry.
